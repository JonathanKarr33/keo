The analysis highlights instances of pilot error leading to forced landings and power loss events, indicating a need for better pilot training in engine maintenance checks.

Key recommendations for improving pilot training in this context include:

1. **Comprehensive Training on Engine Power Checks**: Pilots should receive thorough training on conducting engine power checks, including understanding the significance of the checks, correct procedures for performing them, and interpreting the results accurately. This training should emphasize the critical role of engine health in flight safety.

2. **Emphasis on Error Prevention**: Training programs should stress the importance of error prevention in maintenance checks, highlighting common pitfalls that can lead to power loss or forced landings. Pilots need to be aware of the implications of overlooking engine maintenance tasks and the potential consequences.

3. **Scenario-Based Training**: Incorporating scenario-based training exercises that simulate engine issues and require pilots to troubleshoot and respond effectively can help reinforce proper maintenance check procedures. This hands-on approach can enhance pilot preparedness to handle real-world situations.

4. **Regular Refresher Training**: Continuous education and recurrent training sessions on engine maintenance checks are essential to ensure that pilots stay updated on best practices and remain proficient in performing these critical tasks.

By implementing these recommendations and providing pilots with robust training on engine maintenance checks, aviation operators can mitigate the risks associated with pilot errors in this crucial aspect of aircraft maintenance"
