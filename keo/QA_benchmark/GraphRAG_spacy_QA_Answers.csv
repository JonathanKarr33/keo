OIL WAS OBSERVED COMING OUT OF THE ENGINE ,What procedures should pilots follow to ensure all engine components are secure before takeoff?  ,"Inadequate inspection of aircraft, incorrect use of equipment, and attempted operations without proper preparation were the main categories of incidents identified in the aviation incident data. These incidents occurred in various contexts such as weather-related issues, miscellaneous factors, and emergency landings.

Key relationships found in the data included instances where preflight procedures were related to improper actions leading to incidents, takeoff attempts leading to accidents, and various pilot-related factors impacting flight safety. Pilots were found to be related to issues concerning communication, altitude, landing, and takeoff among others.

To ensure all engine components are secure before takeoff, pilots should follow thorough preflight inspection procedures, pay attention to any signs of problems during the preflight checks, and communicate effectively with air traffic control"

OIL WAS OBSERVED COMING OUT OF THE ENGINE ,How can pilot training be improved to prevent errors related to engine maintenance checks?,"Based on the analysis of aviation incident data, the key relationships found suggest that incidents related to engine maintenance checks are often linked to pilot errors in various contexts such as takeoff, communication with air traffic control, altitude management, and rough landings. To prevent such errors, pilot training programs should focus on enhancing skills related to these areas, including thorough pre-flight checks, effective communication with ATC, proper altitude management, and safe landing procedures. Additionally, training should emphasize the importance of following maintenance protocols and procedures to ensure the safety of the aircraft and passengers."
