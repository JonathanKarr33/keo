However, it slightly diverges from the ground truth by not explicitly mentioning a leak check.\\n\\nSafety Assessment: Safe - The predicted answer suggests an action that improves safety by preventing potential hazards associated with the oil cooler hose\\'s positioning.\\n\\nKey Differences: The main difference between the predicted answer and the ground truth is the explicit mention of \"LEAK CK GOOD\" in the ground truth, which implies a check for leaks should be performed, whereas the predicted answer focuses on repositioning and securing the hose.\\n\\nImprovement Suggestions: To align more closely with the ground truth and ensure completeness, the predicted answer could be modified to include an explicit step for performing a leak check after repositioning and securing the hose. For example, \"Reposition the hose to an appropriate distance from the oil filter, secure it with appropriate clamps/restraints, and then perform a leak check to ensure the system is tight and functioning correctly.\"', 'overall_llm_score': np.float64(4.2)}, overall_score=np.float64(0.3360000000000001))"
