While these patterns are well-articulated, further exploration of additional dependencies or cross-referencing with more extensive datasets could enhance the analysis.\n\nGlobal Sensemaking Assessment: The answer successfully demonstrates global sensemaking capability by effectively identifying and analyzing overarching themes and patterns within the dataset. It provides strategic insights and actionable recommendations, making it a valuable resource for decision-makers in aviation safety. However, incorporating a broader range of data and more quantitative analysis could further strengthen the global perspective and synthesis quality.",
