However, without analyzing the data first, there is a risk of missing underlying issues that could affect safety.\\n\\nClarity: 4 - The instruction to inspect and adjust the propeller governor linkage is clear and understandable, but it lacks context on why this action is being taken in relation to the specific overspeed event.\\n\\nOverall Score: 3.4 - The predicted answer provides a reasonable action but lacks the critical step of data analysis, which is essential for a comprehensive response to the overspeed event.\\n\\nSafety Assessment: Partially Safe - While the action itself is safe, it may not address the root cause of the overspeed without first analyzing the data, which could lead to incomplete resolution of the issue.\\n\\nKey Differences: The predicted answer focuses on mechanical adjustment, while the ground truth emphasizes data analysis to understand the overspeed event.\\n\\nImprovement Suggestions: Include the step of pulling and analyzing the SD card data to determine the exact nature and extent of the overspeed before proceeding with mechanical adjustments.
