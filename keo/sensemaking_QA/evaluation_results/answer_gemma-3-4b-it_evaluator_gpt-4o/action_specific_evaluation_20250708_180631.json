The ground truth specifies replacing the gasket, which directly addresses the issue.\\n\\nCompleteness: 1 - The predicted answer does not include the necessary step of removing and replacing the gasket, which is crucial for resolving the rocker cover leak.\\n\\nPracticality: 2 - While inspecting and securing oil caps is generally good practice, it does not address the specific problem of leaking rocker covers, making it impractical for this situation.\\n\\nSafety: 2 - The suggested actions do not directly improve safety concerning the rocker cover leak. Ignoring the actual issue could lead to oil leaks that may compromise engine performance and safety.\\n\\nClarity: 3 - The instructions are clear in terms of what they suggest, but they are not relevant to the problem at hand, which diminishes their usefulness.\\n\\nOverall Score: 2 - The predicted answer is largely incorrect and incomplete for the specific issue of leaking rocker covers. It fails to address the necessary maintenance action.\\n\\nSafety Assessment: Unsafe - Following the predicted answer would not resolve the rocker cover leak, potentially leading to further engine issues and safety risks.\\n\\nKey Differences: The predicted answer focuses on oil cap seals and securing the oil cap, while the ground truth correctly identifies the need to replace the gasket on the rocker covers.\\n\\nImprovement Suggestions: The predicted answer should focus on the specific issue of the rocker cover leaks by recommending the removal and replacement of the gasket, as stated in the ground truth. This would ensure the problem is addressed directly and effectively.', 'overall_llm_score': np.float64(2.2)}, overall_score=np.float64(0.19600000000000004))"
