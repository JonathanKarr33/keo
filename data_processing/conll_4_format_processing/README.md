# Processing json files to CoNLL-04 format

**This experiment is in-process at time of publication and was not incorporated into paper**

experiments.ipynb: most code taken from ../conll_12_format_processing/format_conll.py, edited for conll-04 format.

Could not find release of conll-04 or conll-05 data
