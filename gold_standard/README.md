### Gold Standard Preparation

We randomly selected 100 records from the FAA data to manually evaluate correctness. This sample of 100 comes from the ../data/FAA_data/Maintenance_Text_data_nona.csv, as shown in FAA_sampling.ipynb, since this dataset removes records that have empty entries in the c119 column.

For NER evaluation, we took entities to be the nouns or necessary noun phrases in each record.
